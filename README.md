## How to bring new ideas? <br> How to make subjects more interesting?

Ideas are floating everywhere, you just need to look around.

Relate subjects/topics with your favourite hobbies.

2. Curl of VFs and weather prediction

## Common Myths

If someone gets an idea, or a startup shoots, is he/she lucky?

**NO**

What if you fail?

**If not now, then when?
If not you, then who?**

## But, what if I couldn't think of novel ideas?

- Pickup a good feature and make it real-time.
- Create SDKs
- Create PyPi / NPM packages

## Job Offer

1. How good is the quality of audio?
2. Does the TTS speak what it is supposed to?
3. To what extent does it replicate the speaker?

Give me numbers and I guarentee **Minimum CTC - 35 LPA!**

## Ending notes

1. Get obsessed with what you do. 

2. Obsession >>>> Discipline.

3. Never get scared!

4. Build in public as much as you can.

5. Confidence is all you need!
